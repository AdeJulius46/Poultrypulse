# 🐔 Poultry Pulse

**Poultry Pulse** is an **AI + IoT-powered poultry health monitoring system** designed to detect common poultry diseases, track environmental conditions, and provide predictive insights to farmers. By combining **Machine Learning, Raspberry Pi sensors, cloud storage (Supabase), a Web App, and Smart Contracts**, Poultry Pulse enables data-driven poultry management while ensuring transparency and accountability.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern poultry farming faces challenges like disease outbreaks, poor environmental monitoring, and lack of accessible data-driven tools for farmers.
**Poultry Pulse** solves this by providing:

* **AI-based disease detection** (Coryza, CRD, Normal) using camera feeds.
* **Environmental monitoring** via sensors (temperature & humidity).
* **Predictive insights** by analyzing historical data trends.
* **Cloud storage** on Supabase for health logs, predictions, and captured images.
* **Farmer dashboard (Web App)** for real-time monitoring and insights.
* **Smart contract integration** for **subscriptions/payments** using blockchain.

## 🧩 Core Functionalities

1. **Disease Detection (AI Model on Pi)**

   * Detects **Coryza**, **CRD**, or **Normal** chickens using a trained ML model (Roboflow-based YOLO).
   * Captures and saves detected chicken images.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**

   * Reads **temperature** and **humidity** data from sensors.
   * Combines sensor data with disease detection for **better predictions**.

3. **Predictive Analysis**

   * Predicts potential disease risks based on **past detection data** + **environmental conditions**.

4. **Data Logging (Supabase)**

   * Stores:

     * Timestamp
     * Detected disease
     * Temperature & humidity readings
     * Prediction outcomes
     * Chicken image snapshot

5. **Farmer Web App (Vercel)**

   * Dashboard to view:

     * Real-time disease detections
     * Environmental trends
     * Prediction insights
   * Data visualization for farm decisions.

6. **Smart Contract Integration**

   * Handles **subscription-based access** to Poultry Pulse.
   * Ensures **transparency and accountability** in payment handling.

Would you like me to also **design a diagram/architecture image** (like a block flow of Pi → Supabase → Web App → Smart Contract) that you can put inside this README? It will make it look more professional.
